Stub for the AI email parser.

This module is intended to be replaced by a real machine learning or
LLM integration. It currently contains a simple function that
extracts a potential order title from an email subject line and
returns a dictionary compatible with the OrderCreate schema.

When implementing a real parser, consider using large language
models, HuggingFace transformers or fineâ€‘tuned classification models
to detect order types, quantities and customer information. For now,
the parser simply returns the entire subject as the order title.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with keys compatible with the OrderCreate schema
